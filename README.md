This is the source code to accompany a YouTube livestream from December 22nd 2023 – it’s a small but complete app for iOS, aimed at helping complete folks take their first steps with SwiftUI and SwiftData.

You can watch the stream’s replay here: https://youtube.com/live/n4SCMC25BxY

This project was built using Xcode 15.1, but should work fine in any newer Xcode version.
